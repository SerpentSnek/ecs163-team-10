# home-page.py, ml-interaction and ml-models
- ```ml-interaction``` contains the HTML file for hosting the front end of machine learning model
- ```ml-models``` is for hosting the machine learning models themselves that will be imported into the website. `ml-notebooks.ipynb` holds the code that generated these models and the static visuals.
- ```home-page.py``` is the server file.

# Running the website
In order to run it, make sure to download `flask` via `pip install flask`. After downloading this repository, open the terminal and input the command `python -m flask app home-page run` or `flask --app home-page run`.
